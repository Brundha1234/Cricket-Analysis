🏏 T20 Cricket Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes T20 World Cup cricket data by combining web scraping, Python preprocessing, and Power BI dashboards.
It provides insights into player performance, match outcomes, and tournament trends, showcasing end-to-end data analysis skills.

📂 Dataset

📄 dim_match_summary.csv → Match-level data (results, teams, venues)

📄 fact_batting_summary.csv → Batting stats (runs, strike rate, boundaries)

📄 fact_bowling_summary.csv → Bowling stats (wickets, economy rate, overs)

📄 dim_players.csv → Player details (role, team, country)

📄 JSON files → Scraped raw data (match results, player info, stats)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🐍 Python → Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests), preprocessing (Pandas)

📓 Jupyter Notebook → Data cleaning & transformation (t20_data_preprocessing.ipynb)

📊 Power BI → Dashboard design & interactive storytelling (Dashboards.pbit)

💾 CSV/JSON → Raw structured datasets

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

✔️ Top run scorers, batting strike rates, and boundary analysis
✔️ Best bowlers by wickets, economy rates, and match impact
✔️ Team-wise performance across matches and tournaments
✔️ Head-to-head records between teams
✔️ Trends in batting vs bowling dominance in T20 cricket

📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

✨ KPI Cards → Total Runs, Total Wickets, Win % by Team
📈 Leaderboards → Top Batsmen & Bowlers
📉 Trend Charts → Player & team performance across matches
🏟️ Match Insights → Venue-based & opponent-based performance
🎛️ Filters → Team, Player, Tournament, Year

📈 Skills Demonstrated

🔹 Web scraping & automated data collection

🔹 Data preprocessing & feature engineering in Python

🔹 Data modeling (fact & dimension tables) for BI

🔹 Storytelling with dashboards in Power BI

🚀 How to Run

⚙️ Run t20_data_preprocessing.ipynb to clean and prepare datasets

📂 Load the CSV/JSON files into Power BI using Dashboards.pbit template
